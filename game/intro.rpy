"Me? Oh, I must've been, what, ten years old, when it all started..."

"1905. Life was sweet. There were more jobs than people, and not just quarter-an-hour newsie jobs neither. Five-dollar a day deals. It was a time of industry, and splendor."

"It didn't last."

show roosevelt with fade

"President Roosevelt came on the radio, and said he had big news. He said that we’d found aliens. The real McCoy."

show oceanfloor with fade

"Not live aliens--a ship, real real old, at the bottom of the ocean. Far as we could tell, it’d been there since before dinosaurs, and something had woken it up."

"It was sending out signals--these real strong, aimed pulses...some German scientist said they looked like brainwaves."

"We don't know how it chooses its targets. But we do know the effects."

show cocoon with fade

"We weren’t sure what was happening at first. Thought it was a new disease where people’s skin got hard like caterpillar cocoons. At first, doctors tried to cut into the pods, to free the people…"

"But there was nothing but goo inside."

"When caterpillars change into butterflies, there’s a period where their entire body dissolves, and there’s nothing to let you know they’re ever gonna reform."

"Scientists killed a lot of xenohumans, before they knew they could reform."

"It takes a few days. But if you leave the cocoons alone, eventually the people inside start to firm up again. Not quite the same—they tend to have different organs, and organs in different places. And they tend to be a little tougher."

"And they have powers."

show transformation with fade

"They’re disoriented at first. Or...more than disoriented. They’ve just had every part of their body melt and reform into something else—if they’re even done changing. They’ve spent the last two days having synaesthetic alien nightmares, and they can’t quite tell how many limbs they’re supposed to have."

"Now they’re a conduit for unknowable powers not of this world…"

"...and America needs them to go to war."
#
# (Bg superpowered trench warfare)
#
#
# There was a war over which nation got to keep the ship, of course.
#
# The war was bloody and patriotic, but it didn’t really matter. Nobody could get into the ship, which seemed to be doing its thing no matter where it was or what it was encased in. No, the problem with the war was it demonstrated to the governments that xenos outclassed most weapons.
#
# I remember hearing the President describing America’s “new special forces”. Whoo, that was a moment.
#
# There were recruitment drives. There were cash incentives. And once all the gung-ho xenos were already joining up, there was talk of a draft. The conflict showed no sign of slowing down…
#
# ...until Seera.
#
# (preaching to the cults)
#
# She was a xeno, and one of the most strategically important ones—she got visions of the future.
#
# She told everyone that they were idiots, and that they needed to stop fighting. There were worse things coming, and soon—the alien transformation had never been good for anyone’s minds, but we were about to get a run of people losing it entirely, and going on a giant destructive monsters.
#
# She was ignored by most. There was a war on, after all.
#
# So the first of the berserkers took us mostly by surprise.
#
# (splash page: some Attack on Titan looking monster devouring a human in a burning city)
#
# The rate was something like one in a thousand. Most of the humans that came out of the transformation were terrified and insane for a few hours, but these…
#
# ...they seemed to be in a permanent violent fugue, with no motivation other than destruction. What’s more, they tended to be strong—whatever drove them to rampage also turned them into city-killing horrors.
#
# The war was put on indefinite hold as humanity collectively sat down to try to figure out what to do.
#
# But Seera wasn’t done.
#
# (Seera preaching again)
#
# She said there were more aliens coming, just a few years off. She gave a date: February 9, 1913.
#
# They weren't coming to conquer us by force, like in the pulps, but just to sort of...add us to their empire. Like Britain used to do. Elevate a few of us into overseers, turn the rest into slaves, gradually strip the planet of anything valuable, and move on.
#
# For a couple months, it wasn't clear that the world wasn't gonna turn into a bloodbath. For all that the nations were in a ceasefire due to the new berserker problem, there was only so much camaraderie to go around when you’re worried the other guy will sell you to aliens first.
#
# But the nations got the message. And so to keep the Earth—all of us—from selling each other for the right to be eaten last, they formed a coalition. United Earth, they called it.
#
# (Bg united earth (logo? UN?))
#
# It was slow and testy and bureaucratic, but a time of optimism and unity began.
#
# At the time, the xenos and berserkers were almost an afterthought. Alien onslaught on the way, after all. Domestically, each nation was faced with the lunatic fringe reacting like, well, lunatics. Paranoia, violence. The scared people bought bunkers and the apocalypse nuts bought guns.
#
# Within each nation, too, there were the Seerists.
#
# Bg cults
#
# Seera cults became so popular they weren't cults any more. It became a world religion. 12th biggest, I hear, right on the heels of Tao. Worshipped the aliens, Seera, the xenohumans. Don't know if it was bona fide awe or just boot-licking, but something about supermen and the alien rapture put a real reverence into folk.
#
# Bg black
#
# But though people panicked and groups hunkered down, nations stood strong, and together.
#
# Bg united earth
#
# If the aliens wanted to deal with humanity, it was a united humanity they would find. Economic relations between nations boomed, and nations began to specialize, as the United Earth prepared for the long haul.
#
# The States' military budget increased fourfold, as it prepared to become the military arm of the planet. Other nations specialized in their own ways—I think India did textiles? I don't really remember the rest.
#
# It was a time of peace, and brotherhood, and dread. It was a golden age, and we didn't know it.
#
# It only last for four years.
#
# Bg (expectant people looking at the skies)
#
# Seera predicted the aliens would come February 9th. The month before then, some parts of the world worked in a frenzy, and others slowed to a halt. Schools closed. Workplaces closed.
#
# I heard a rumor, that just in case, United Earth had chosen a single supreme commander for the planet. It that was true, their name and nationality was never revealed.
#
# The time came. Every radio was tuned to the broadcast, everyone was watching the skies.
#
# Monitoring devices were trained at the ground, the sea, the stars. The world held its breath.
#
# For nothing.
#
# Bg black
#
# There were false reports. Millions of them. Like the Virgin Mary appearing on toast, times ten thousand. And as time passed, and nations started to wonder if aliens had landed in secret, tension mounted.
#
# It got much worse when Seera killed herself.
#
# Old distrusts came back with a vengeance. Nations began to suspect each other, either of dealing under the table for the whole human race, or of perhaps setting up this whole “alien” farce for their own gain. The fragile peace which had held us all...
#
# ...began to crack.
#
# During the time of peace and a united humanity, all the little border disputes, the games of pushing a little farther than the other guy, they had all drawn to a standstill. But those tense weeks after the Day of No Hope were ripe for something big. With every newspaper and  government on such high alert, the worldwide unease became unbearable.
#
# Weeks passed. And of course there were many urging the politicians to wait. The leaders of most nations made calming noises and desperate measures to try to hold onto the unified earth. But slowly, unstoppably, we slid back into the game of suspicion and backstabbing that no one wanted.
#
# The human faith had been broken. It was not recovering.
#
# (Bg riots, molotovs, some flying dude throwing fireballs )
#
# People were people, in the end. There was a wide spread of reactions, and some did better than others. But there were bad ones, and those bad ones were pretty bad.
#
# Riots, mass suicides. Humanity had been given a miracle and asked for faith. There were claims to the legitimacy of Seera. There were claims that the whole thing was a United States ploy to win the upcoming war, convincing other countries to step down their military spending. People started to wonder whether berserkers were a hoax too, whether the powers were a hoax, if anything was real.
#
# The powers were still real. Unfortunately, of those people, the ones who reacted badly...some of them had powers.
#
# This was a real goddamn problem.
#
# (bg Deathwise)
#
# Without a unifying goal—global war or an incoming alien armada—suddenly there were thousands of xenos without a clear purpose. People with incredible, destabilizing abilities...and no real life direction. Many turned to crime. Some turned to hedonism...others, nihilism.
#
# Something needed to be done.
#
# (Bg XRB_logo (basically the FBI logo))
#
# The Xenohuman Response Branch was founded.
#
# The XRB was charged with maintaining the rule of law on the xenohuman population, investigating crimes, and protecting against emergent Tyrant threats. What’s more, the XRB served as symbol of human cooperation—to show people that xenos can work for the public good.
#
# The one you run is in Chicago.
#
# Bg chicago skyline.
#
# A cross between police station, recruitment office, and public utility, the men and women of the XRB find themselves hastily equipped, and given a monumental task: keep the city safe.
